# Attention-based Binary Classification Model

## Overview

Welcome to the "Explainable_AI" repository! This project features a minimal binary classification model with an integrated Attention layer. This implementation is designed for rapid experimentation and is not intended for production use. It serves as a tool to explore the behavior of the Attention matrix and attention-based embedding for simple toy problems.

## Features

- Binary classification model with Attention layer.
- Fast and lightweight implementation.
- Ideal for exploring Attention matrix behavior.
- Attention-based embedding for simple toy problems.

## Disclaimer

**Note:** This code is not tested and should be used solely for educational and experimental purposes. It may not be suitable for production scenarios.
